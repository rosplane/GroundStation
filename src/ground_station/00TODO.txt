waypoint types:
	- main (all waypoints in one)
	- waypoint path (ones given by the competition)
	- search
	- bottle drop
	- off-axis target
	- hiker

Long-term
	- clean up code (using a custom widget class with static members that everyone can access)
		- look for repetitive code, make everything modular (unique info originating from a single source)
	- do we really want pop-up windows?
	- to C++ for Ubuntu 16.04?
